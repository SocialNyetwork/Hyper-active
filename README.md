# What is Hyper?
Hyper is a modpack for 1.20.1+ that takes advantage of Fabric staples to drastically improve performance on [Neo]Forge.

Due to the nature of this pack it has come to my attention that Prism launcher mistakenly installs Fabric instead of Forge, you can fix this by removing Fabric from the 'Versions' tab.
## _Why shouldn't I use Optifine?_
1. Optifine doesn't age like fine wine. It's based off of code written nearly a decade ago that hasn't seen a major rewrite since.
2. Optifine is a sloppy mod. It deletes crucial Forge render pipelines: making compatibility shoddy at best and a nightmare at worst.
3. It's performance improvements are negligable on newer hardware, where as Hyper offers pinpoint optimizations for modern Nvidia GPUs.
## We're built on FOSS!
Every mod contained within Hyper is free, open source, or falls under a permissive license. If you really appreciate a particular mod, I implore you to contribute to their Ko-Fi or Patreon. This project wouldn't be possible without them.
